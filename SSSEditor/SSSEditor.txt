SSS Editor is a .NET application for managing the Custom SSS code, on its own
or within a Brawl or Project M codeset. The program allows modification and
reordering of the stage/icon pair definitions (first tab - third part of the
code), as well as the order and number of icons on the Brawl and Melee screens
(2nd and 3rd tabs). You can also preview what the SSS or My Music screens
would look like (4th-7th tabs).

To run, the program needs a .txt or .gct file that contains the Custom SSS
code, and a common5/sc_selmap/mu_menumain file (which will not be modified.)

-------- Stage Control Guide --------

| Icon | 0. [ BATTLEFIELD       ↓] mmm |C|
| Icon |    [ PP ] SS II [ NN ] [↑][↓] |C|

BATTLEFIELD	The stage to load. You can choose a stage from the dropdown, enter
			a stage ID in hex, or enter "c" followed by a hex byte for the
			corresponding STGCUSTOM.
mmm			The song that plays on the stage - only appears if you have a
			Stage-Dependent Song Loader code for this stage in your codeset.
CC			A color indicating whether your stage will be shown on My Music
			and/or chosen on random - see below.

##			(hex) The item's position in the list you're currently looking at.
PP			(hex) The position of the stage/icon definition on tab 1.
			      On tabs 2 and 3, change this value to determine which stage appears.
SS			(hex) The stage ID.
II			(hex) The icon ID.
NN			(dec) The icon ID. Editable on tab 1.

To change a stage's position in the list, use the up/down buttons on the right
or click the radio button on the left and use your keyboard's up/down keys.

-------- Detailed documentation --------

The first tab - Stage/Icon Pairs - edits the third part of the Custom SSS code (see below.) Each entry has three elements - the stage, the icon, and its position in the list.

* To change the stage, use the drop-down list to select the .pac file to load.
* To change the icon/name/stage preview, use the right-hand number box to
  enter the number of the icon. For example, to show MenSelmapIcon.12, you
  would enter 12. (Anything besides 01-31 or 50-59 requires the PAT0 entries
  in your common5 to be correct - the PAT0 key is actually what you're
  entering here.)
* The bar on the right-hand side of the entry shows whether your stage will
  show up on My Music (green/red) and whether it will be available on random
  (green/yellow.) This is determined by the stage's position in the list.
  * Note: if you have the "enable random expansion stages" code on, EVERY
    stage will be selectable on random, regardless of the in-game setting.

The second and third tabs determine the stage order and number of stages on
each page. The maximum number of stages on one page is 39.
To change the stage/icon, use the left-hand number box to enter the hex number
that you see in the corresponding box on tab 1.

IMPORTANT: If you have 39 stages on page 2, one of them should be the stage
with the yellow bar! Otherwise, you'll end up with 40 when you go to My Music,
and the game will freeze.

-------- SSS Preview --------

Tabs 4 through 7 will give you a rough preview of what the SSS looks like.
You can't edit the layout from SSS Editor; instead, use BrawlBox to edit the
animation MenSelmapPos_TopN__0 (normal) or MenSelmapPos_TopN__1 (My Music),
frame (n+2), where "n" is the number of icons on the screen.

If you want to look at the My Music layout, you should load mu_menumain.pac
instead of common5.pac - this is where Brawl reads the My Music data from!

-------- Custom SSS code (behind the scenes) --------

The Custom SSS code [Spunit, Phantom Wings] has this format:
046B8F5C 7C802378
046B8F64 7C6300AE
040AF618 5460083C
040AF68C 38840002
040AF6AC 5463083C
040AF6C0 88030001
040AF6E8 3860FFFF
040AF59C 3860000C
060B91C8 00000018
BFA10014 7CDF3378
7CBE2B78 7C7D1B78
2D05FFFF 418A0014
006B929C 000000XX
066B99D8 000000XX
-------- -------- (Page 1)
006B92A4 000000YY
066B9A58 000000YY
-------- -------- (Page 2)
06407AAC 000000ZZ
-------- -------- (Stage/Icon List)

XX = # of bytes in Page 1 section
YY = # of bytes in Page 2 section
ZZ = # of bytes in stage/icon list section

The stage/icon list in part 3 of the code takes the format:
[stage][icon][stage][icon] [stage][icon][stage][icon] ...
where [stage] is the stage ID - the same one used in modifying the .rel files - and icon is the icon number, in hex.
The 41st value is reserved for the Menu icon on My Music, so its value doesn't make any difference, but it should be skipped over when adding expansion stages.

The page 1 and page 2 sections take the format:
[index][index][index][index] [index][index][index][index] ...
where [index] is a reference to the stage/icon list below. For example, putting "0C" here would refer to the 13th stage defined in the list (you count from 0, and 0C = 12 in decimal.)

-------- Changes --------

Changes in 3.2:
	* Tooltip on song filename now shows 4-digit ID and default song name
	* ./minusery/pf/system/common5.pac added to default search paths
	* Other changes to work with updates in BrawlManagerLib.dll
